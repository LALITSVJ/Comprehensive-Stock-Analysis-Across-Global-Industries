# Comprehensive-Stock-Analysis-Across-Global-Industries
Multi-Factor Stock Analysis and Strategy Design Using Real-World Financial Data with Case Study on Apple &amp; Adidas companies

This project analyzes real-world financial data of global companies to study the impact of market volatility, dividends, stock splits, and bonus shares on both short- and long-term stock behavior. It also benchmarks industry-wise stock performance and proposes investment strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world financial data of global companies to study the impact of market volatility, dividends, stock splits, and bonus shares on both short- and long-term stock behavior. It also benchmarks industry-wise stock performance and proposes investment strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Objectives

- Examine how dividends, stock splits, and bonus shares influence stock price, volume, and volatility.
- Compare volatility and performance across different industries.
- Simulate and evaluate buy-and-hold vs. active trading strategies for Adidas stock from 2019 to 2023.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

- High-volatility industries like Cryptocurrency (5.13%) and Fitness (5.09%) showed relatively low returns (~1.2x and ~1.1x), whereas sectors like Luxury Goods (10x) and Finance (~8.8x) combined moderate volatility with strong compounding returns, making them attractive for long-term investments.
- Industries that fluctuated more weren’t always the best performers. In fact, sectors like luxury goods and finance combined moderate volatility with high compounding, making them attractive from a long-term investment perspective.
- A simple moving average (SMA) trading strategy for Adidas significantly outperformed the traditional buy-and-hold approach, achieving a 63.18% return versus 0.33%, resulting in a 62.86% higher portfolio value over the 2019–2023 period.
